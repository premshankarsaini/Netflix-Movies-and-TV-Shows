# Netflix Movies and TV Shows

## Task Objective:
As part of my internship, I was assigned a task to clean and preprocess the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows** dataset using Excel and Python (Pandas).

## Dataset Used:
* **Name**: Netflix Movies and TV Shows
* **Source:** Kaggle – Netflix Dataset
* **File:** netflix_titles.csv

## Tools Used:
* **Microsoft Excel** – for initial data cleaning
* **Python (Pandas)** – for further cleaning and validation

## Cleaning Tasks Performed:
**Using Excel:**
* Removed duplicate rows
* Handled missing values in key columns (like date_added, country, etc.)
* Standardized text (e.g., title casing for titles/countries)
* Removed rows with too many null values

**Using Pandas:**
* Verified and converted date columns (e.g., date_added)
* Removed any leftover null or invalid entries
* Checked data types of all columns
* Renamed columns (if needed) for consistency
